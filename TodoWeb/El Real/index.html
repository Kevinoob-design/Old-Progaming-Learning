		<h1>THIS IS THE MAIN TITTLE</h1>

		<p>"Something" is a song by the Beatles, written by George Harrison and released on the band's 1969 album Abbey Road. It was also issued as a single coupled with another track from the album, "Come Together". "Something" was the first Harrison composition to appear as a Beatles A-side, and the only song written by him to top the US charts before the band's break-up in April 1970. The single was also one of the first Beatles singles to contain tracks already available on an LP album.</p>

		<h2>THIS IS THE MAIN TITTLE</h2>

		<p>George Harrison began writing "Something" in September 1968, during a session for the Beatles' self-titled double album, commonly known as "the White Album".[4] In his autobiography, I, Me Mine, he recalls working on the melody on a piano, while Paul McCartney carried out overdubs in a neighbouring studio at London's Abbey Road Studios.[5] Harrison put the composition "on ice" at first,[6] believing that with the tune having come to him so easily, it might have been the melody from another song.[7] In I, Me, Mine, he adds that the middle eight for "Something" "took some time to sort out"</p>
